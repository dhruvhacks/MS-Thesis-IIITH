\chapter{Experiments and Discussion}
\label{ch:exp}

We present our experimental setup in Sec.~\ref{sec:data} before diving into the implementation details in Sec.~\ref{sec:impl}.
A series of ablation studies motivate the design choices of our model (Sec.~\ref{sec:abl}) while we compare against the adapted versions of various SoTA models for emotion recognition in Sec.~\ref{sec:sota}.
Finally, we present some qualitative analysis and discuss how our model switches from facial expressions to video or dialog context depending on the label in Sec.~\ref{sec:selfattn}.
